summary: A wave is a disturbance in a medium that carries energy without a net movement of particles. It may take the form of elastic deformation, a variation of pressure, electric or magnetic intensity, electric potential, or temperature.

## What are waves??

> Waves are a transferring energy from place to place.
## What are wavefront

> A wavefront is a line where all the vibrations are in phase and the same distance from the source
## Types of waves

> Waves come in two kinds, longitudinal and transverse
## About transverse waves

> a transverse wave is one that vibrates or oscillates, at right angles to the direction in which the energy or wave is moving.

## About longitudinal waves

> A longitudinal wave is one in which the vibrations, oscillations are along the direction in which the energy or wave is moving.
